# 📦 Data Structures in Python

This repository contains clean and simple implementations of fundamental **data structures** in Python,
written from scratch for learning and demonstration purposes. Each file provides a working,
testable version of a specific structure — without using Python’s built-in data structures directly (where applicable).
